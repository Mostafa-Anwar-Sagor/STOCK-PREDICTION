Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project implements a deep learning approach to predict stock prices using historical data. The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks from TensorFlow/Keras, and it forecasts the closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on historical closing price data from Yahoo Finance.

Overview
The main goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of LSTM networks to predict future stock prices. Using historical closing price data, the model learns temporal patterns to forecast future closing prices. This project demonstrates how to process time-series financial data, train a deep learning model, and evaluate its performance using key metrics.

Methodology
Data Collection:

Historical AAPL stock prices were downloaded via the yfinance package covering the period from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2024.

Data Preprocessing:

Only the 'Close' price is used.

The data is normalized to a 0â€“1 scale using the MinMaxScaler.

Sequence Creation:

Sequences of a fixed length (90 days) are created to capture historical price trends.

The model uses these sequences as input to predict the next day's closing price.

Model Architecture:

The model consists of two LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.

It includes dense layers to consolidate the features learned by LSTM.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.0003.

Early stopping is implemented to avoid overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Emphasizes larger errors.

RÂ² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-Anwar-Sagor/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you do not have a requirements.txt file, install the following packages:

bash
Copy
pip install yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
Usage
Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository. For example, if using a Jupyter Notebook, open the Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb file and run the cells sequentially.

The key steps are:

Download AAPL data using Yahoo Finance.

Normalize the data and create sequences.

Build and train the LSTM model.

Evaluate the model using performance metrics.

Plot the actual vs. predicted prices.

Performance Evaluation
After running the model, the following evaluation metrics were obtained on the test data:

ðŸ“ˆ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.41
The modelâ€™s predictions deviate from actual values by an average of $4.41.

ðŸ“‰ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 5.63
This metric shows that large deviations are infrequent and remain within $5.63.

âœ… RÂ² Score: 0.8940
Approximately 89.4% of the variance in the actual stock prices is explained by the model.

Results
A professionally styled plot is generated, comparing the actual closing prices to the modelâ€™s predictions. The plot includes:

A clear trend line for actual prices.

A dashed line for the predicted prices.

Annotated performance metrics displayed in a text box on the graph.

This plot is ideal for showcasing the effectiveness of the model and can be shared directly on LinkedIn or other professional platforms.

Future Enhancements
To further improve the model and work towards even higher prediction accuracy (targeting RÂ² scores around or above 0.98), consider the following enhancements:

Feature Expansion: Incorporate additional features such as volume, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), or even news sentiment.

Advanced Architectures: Experiment with deeper or hybrid models (e.g., combining CNNs and LSTMs or using Transformer-based methods).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.

Data Augmentation: Use longer historical periods or multi-stock datasets for a more robust training process.
